# Releases

## v-0.0.6

- Added this CHANGELOG
- First attempt at dropping formatting rules
  - Also turned **off** formatting rules in Standard JS
- NPM updates

ESLint is [deprecating formatting rules](https://eslint.org/blog/2023/10/deprecating-formatting-rules/). This update largely swaps out formatting rules, turning them off, where [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) has them on.

Probably needs more testing. Tweaks are to be expected.
